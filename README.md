# figshare API User Documentation

The home of figshare's API user documentation.

During the evolution of the API documentation there have been various iterations
and in this latest form we use Swagger to generate the pages and examples.

This system requires the `swagger.json` file (which can be found in the _swagger_documentation_ 
directory to be in sync with the one found in the [Rest API](https://github.com/figshare/apiv1) 
repository at `figshare_api2/api_docs/`.


## Contributing

In order to contribute you need to send a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/).

### Git workflow

Any development will be done on the developer branch which should follow 
the `developer/feature` naming format. Feature identifier should contain only
words split with `'-'` (ex. `greatest-feature-ever-whatever`).

Code will be sent to be reviewed before merging it to `master` by other
colleagues and _Approved_ by at least two.

The description of a git commit should look like the following:

    FIG-12345(feature): Commit message

This is the **FIG-12345** part is the JIRA FIG number. This should generally
not be missing.  
**(feature)** is the feature you're working on.


#### Merging into master

To merge into master you need to keep the following in mind:

* code review needs to be done with two _Approves_ at least
* code needs to be _blackened_
* tests need to pass
* commits need to be rebased on the latest master

Merging into master has to be done with `--ff-only`:

    git merge --ff-only <branch>

:warning: **Attention**

> **Don't use** merge pull-request feature of github.


## Development

To be able to build the documentation one needs to install the necessary
dependencies:

    $ make swagger_configure

To build the documentation:

    $ make swagger_build

To check the generated documentation:

    $ cd swagger_documentation/
    $ python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000

and open http://localhost:8000/ in your browser.

Finally when the documentation needs to be deployed to various instances we have
various Jenkins jobs to do that.

:warning: Before creating the pull request make sure you have built
the documentation.
